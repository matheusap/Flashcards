SRS Flashcards
Android app implemented in Java with a SQLite database for the backend.

Allows user to create flashcards and, using an SRS system, organizes the cards to present the user with daily reviews.

As my first Android app, I wanted to learn as much as I could from this ongoing project. With the basic purpose of 
working as a flashcard application, I was able to learn about working with several activities. Having to save data 
for each flashcard (next review time), I was also introduced to how SQL databases work in Android. 

The goal for this application, while being an incredible learning experience, is ultimately to create a robust and 
easy to use flashcard app and publishing to the Play Store.
